## Description

This module installs the `acpid` package and ensures the service is running.

### This is a SIMP module
This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP), a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our [JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

Please read our [Contribution Guide](http://simp-doc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html)

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but it can be used independently:
* When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will be managed from the Puppet server.
* If used independently, all SIMP-managed security subsystems are disabled by default and must be explicitly opted into by administrators.  Please review the simp_options module for details.

## Setup

### What acpid affects

* installs the `acpid` package
* manages the `acpid` and `haldaemon` services


### Beginning with acpid

To use this module, just include the class:
```puppet
include 'acpid'
```

## Usage

You can optioally pin the version of the `acpid` package by specifying the `$ensure` variable when calling the class:

```puppet
class { 'acpid':
  ensure => 'latest'
}
```

## Limitations

SIMP Puppet modules are generally intended for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and compatible distributions, such as CentOS. Please see the [`metadata.json` file](./metadata.json) for the most up-to-date list of supported operating systems, Puppet versions, and module dependencies.

## Development

Please see the [SIMP Contribution Guidelines](http://simp-doc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html).


### Acceptance tests

This module includes [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) acceptance tests using the SIMP [Beaker Helpers](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers).  By default the tests use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) as a back-end; Vagrant and VirtualBox must both be installed to run these tests without modification. To execute the tests run the following:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake beaker:suites
```

Please refer to the [SIMP Beaker Helpers documentation](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

Some environment variables may be useful:

```shell
BEAKER_debug=true
BEAKER_provision=no
BEAKER_destroy=no
BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes
```

* `BEAKER_debug`: show the commands being run on the STU and their output.
* `BEAKER_destroy=no`: prevent the machine destruction after the tests finish so you can inspect the state.
* `BEAKER_provision=no`: prevent the machine from being recreated. This can save a lot of time while you're writing the tests.
* `BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes`: cause all module dependencies to be loaded from the `spec/fixtures/modules` directory, based on the contents of `.fixtures.yml`.  The contents of this directory are usually populated by `bundle exec rake spec_prep`.  This can be used to run acceptance tests to run on isolated networks.
